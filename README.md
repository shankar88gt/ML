# ML
This repository has working code for all basic ML alogoriths. 
the code also contains a pdf which explains what the project is and what it tries to accomplish. 

Projects
1) Linear regression - One variable and mutiple input variables with gradient decent optimization
2) Logistic regression - linear seperation & polynominal seperation with regarlization. some extent of hyperpatermeter tuning
3) Mutlicalss Logistic regression ( One vs ALL ) & Feedforward Neural Network
4) Handwritten digit recognition using NN -  1 HL with Feedward & Back propogation with regularization. Logistic with sigmoid gradient
